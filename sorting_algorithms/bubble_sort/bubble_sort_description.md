This is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly checks adjacent elements and if they are not in order it swaps them. This is done through multiple passes on a list. For each iteration, the largest element in the array will "bubble" to the top. The efficiency or worst case  of this algorithm is O(nË†2). This is however considered not to be a practical sorting algorithm.
